## Data model

The site runs on 19 tables in Cloudflare D1 (SQLite). The schema is defined in `db/schema.ts` and created by the migrations in `drizzle/`. Final ERD:

Sample rows from nine of the tables: [docs/sample-rows.png](docs/sample-rows.png).

## Local preview

Requires Node 22.13 or newer.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Canar8ue/BYUCalendar.git
cd BYUCalendar
npm run install:ci                 # locked dependency install
node scripts/run-framework.mjs dev # dev app (read the actual preview port from the output)
```

The calendar loads with the checked-in seed data (`data/seed.json`); no environment configuration is needed to browse, search, filter, or export.

## Verification

`npm test`, `node node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc --noEmit`, `npm run build`, then `npm run test:worker`.

## Hosting

The calendar is self-hosted at https://byucalendar.com with Nginx, systemd, a local SQLite (Cloudflare D1) database, and a refresh cron every 20 minutes. See [the deployment runbook](deploy/DEPLOY.md).
